        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I'm a Software Engineer based out of Chicago and a graduate of Actualize Coding Bootcamp. I began learning about code at a young age but it wasn't until recently that I decided to develop my passion into a career in technology. I've always had an affinity for problem-solving and there's no better feeling than when a solution comes together! My motto is that every new problem leads to a new lesson and I love applying those lessons in my personal projects</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me on the beach playing volleyball or way outside of the city, camping underneath the stars. I'm a big sports fan and after having been to championship parades for both the Cubs and the Blackhawks, I'm hoping the next one will be for my Chicago Bulls ðŸ¤ž</p>
